## Getting Started 🚀

Wanna check out the code or run it locally? Here's how you can get started:

### Prerequisites 👉

Make sure you have:

* A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to view the application.

### Cloning the Repository 👇

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine using git:

    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/GourangaDasSamrat/Currency-Converter.git
    ```
   


2.  Navigate into the project directory:

## Important Note/Disclaimer 💡

This project relies on the [ExchangeRate-API](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/) to fetch real-time exchange rates. This means you need an active internet connection for the conversions to work correctly. The API provides free access for a certain number of requests per month, which is great for personal projects like this!
